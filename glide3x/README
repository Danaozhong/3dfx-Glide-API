Here are a few notes about building Glide3x from CVS.

The Glide source trees are branced by platform and the platform names are
internal names used at 3dfx.  Since these name may not make sense to others
here is a quick list.

SST1:  Voodoo Graphics
SST96: Voodoo Rush
CVG:   Voodoo 2
H3:    Voodoo Banshee/Voodoo 3

There is a single toplevel makefile for glide3x.  To select a build for
either cvg or h3 set FX_GLIDE_HW to either cvg or h3.  The default is to
build for h3.

All glide source trees use a common set of libraries kept in the swlibs branch.
In order to build any glide library the swlibs branch must be moved inside
the glide3x directory.  The swlibs branch is not stored here within the cvs
tree because it is also shared with the glide2x branch.
