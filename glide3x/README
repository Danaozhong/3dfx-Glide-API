Here are a few notes about building Glide3x from CVS.

The Glide source trees are branced by platform and the platform names are
internal names used at 3dfx.  Since these name may not make sense to others
here is a quick list.

sst1:  Voodoo Graphics
sst96: Voodoo Rush
cvg:   Voodoo 2
h3:    Voodoo Banshee/Voodoo 3

There is a single toplevel makefile for glide3x.  To select a build for
either cvg or h3 set FX_GLIDE_HW to either cvg or h3.  The default is to
build for h3.  There is no Glide3x project for sst1 or sst96.

All glide source trees use a common set of libraries kept in the
swlibs branch.  In order to build any glide library the swlibs branch
must be moved inside the glide3x directory.  The swlibs branch is not
stored here within the glide3x cvs tree because it is also shared with
the glide2x branch.

A special note about H3:
Currently the Glide3 H3 source is setup to build as a DRI client.  It is
possible to compile Glide3 for H3 as a standalone library.  At this time
the sources are not setup to do this.
