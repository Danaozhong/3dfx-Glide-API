Build instructions
------------------

The new build system supports Linux kernel legacy build systems
as used on 2.4.x or earlier and the new kbuild system used on 2.6
and up.

Current make targets are:

	modules
	clean
	install

If your kernel source is in some place different than /usr/src/linux
specify the KSRC variable, like:

	$ make KSRC=~/src/linux

If you want to install in a different base dir specify DESTDIR.
