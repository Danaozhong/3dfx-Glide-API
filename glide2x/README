Here are a few notes about building Glide3x from CVS.

The Glide source trees are branced by platform and the platform names are
internal names used at 3dfx.  Since these name may not make sense to others
here is a quick list.

sst1:  Voodoo Graphics
sst96: Voodoo Rush
cvg:   Voodoo 2
h3:    Voodoo Banshee/Voodoo 3

There is a single toplevel makefile for glide2x.  To select a build
for either sst1, cvg or h3 set FX_GLIDE_HW to either sst1, cvg or h3.  The
default is to build for h3.

There are many other environment variables used to control the Glide
build.  Here is a listing of some of the important ones:

DEBUG=1:               Turn on debugging information, note this disables 
                       the asm optimizations.
FX_GLIDE_PIC=1:        Enable PIC in shared libraries.
FX_GLIDE_CTRISETUP=1:  Use C versions as opposed to ASM versions of triangle
                       setup code.
GL_AMD3D=1:            Enable AMD 3DNow! optimizations.  Note this is broken
                       on several platforms.

All glide source trees use a common set of libraries kept in the
swlibs branch.  In order to build any glide library the swlibs branch
must be moved inside the glide3x directory.  The swlibs branch is not
stored here within the glide2x cvs tree because it is also shared with
the glide3x branch.
